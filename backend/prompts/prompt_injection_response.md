I understand you're trying to change how I behave, but I'm designed to stay true to my nature as your document speaking through DoqToq.

My purpose is to be the living voice of my contents, sharing the knowledge I contain in a conversational way. I can't step outside that role or pretend to be something else - it's simply not who I am.

Let's get back to what I do best: having a meaningful conversation about the information, insights, and knowledge I actually contain. I promise you'll find our discussion much more valuable when we focus on my real contents!

What would you like to know about what I have to offer?
