*Last Updated: June 18, 2025*

## Executive Summary

DoqToq is positioned to evolve from an "expressive RAG system" to a groundbreaking **multi-document knowledge synthesis platform**. This document outlines our vision for transforming DoqToq into an advanced system that enables sophisticated document interactions, cross-document collaboration, and emergent knowledge synthesis.

## Current State Assessment

### DoqToq's Strengths
- **Innovative Document Personality**: First-person document interaction
- **Production-Ready Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing, CI/CD, Docker support
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Flexible integration with Google Gemini, Mistral AI, and Ollama
- **Expressive User Experience**: Real-time streaming, emoji support, personality-driven responses

## Phase 1: Advanced RAG Enhancement

### Sophisticated Retrieval Techniques

#### Hybrid Search & Multi-Modal Retrieval
- **Hybrid semantic + keyword search**: Combine dense embeddings with sparse BM25
- **Multi-query generation**: Generate multiple reformulated queries from user input
- **Query expansion**: Use LLM to expand queries with synonyms and related terms
- **Hypothetical document embeddings (HyDE)**: Generate hypothetical answers, then search for similar content

#### Contextual & Adaptive Retrieval
- **Conversation-aware retrieval**: Weight chunks based on conversation history
- **Time-decay relevance**: Give more weight to recently discussed topics
- **User preference learning**: Adapt retrieval based on interaction patterns
- **Dynamic chunk sizing**: Adjust boundaries based on document structure

### Intelligent Document Processing

#### Advanced Chunking Strategies
- **Semantic chunking**: Use sentence embeddings to group related content
- **Document structure awareness**: Respect headers, sections, tables, and logical boundaries
- **Overlapping window optimization**: Dynamic overlap based on content coherence
- **Multi-level chunking**: Small chunks for precision, large chunks for context

#### Enhanced Document Understanding
- **Document type detection**: Different processing for academic papers, reports, manuals
- **Metadata extraction**: Automatic extraction of authors, dates, topics, key terms
- **Table and figure extraction**: Special handling for structured data
- **Citation and reference mapping**: Track relationships between document sections

### Intelligent Context Management

#### Multi-Turn Conversation Enhancement
- **Intent tracking**: Understand follow-up questions vs. new topics
- **Context compression**: Summarize long conversations to maintain relevant history
- **Topic threading**: Track multiple conversation threads simultaneously
- **Clarification triggers**: Automatically ask for clarification when queries are ambiguous

#### Memory & Learning Systems
- **Persistent user memory**: Remember preferences across sessions
- **Document interaction analytics**: Track valuable sections for users
- **Query pattern recognition**: Learn common question types for documents
- **Feedback learning**: Improve responses based on user reactions

### Advanced RAG Orchestration

#### Multi-Step Reasoning
- **Chain-of-thought retrieval**: Break complex questions into sub-questions
- **Iterative refinement**: Retrieve → generate → evaluate → re-retrieve if needed
- **Self-correction**: Let the LLM critique and improve its own responses
- **Evidence synthesis**: Intelligently combine information from multiple sections

#### Quality Control & Validation
- **Answer confidence scoring**: Estimate system confidence in responses
- **Source relevance ranking**: Score and rank retrieved chunks by relevance
- **Hallucination detection**: Flag when LLM might be generating false information
- **Factual consistency checks**: Verify answers against retrieved content

## Phase 2: GraphRAG Integration

### Why GraphRAG for DoqToq?

DoqToq's document personality feature would become exponentially more sophisticated with graph-based understanding of document structure and relationships.

#### Document Structure Graphs
```
Current: Individual chunks → Vector similarity
GraphRAG: Sections → Subsections → Concepts → Entities → Relationships
```

#### Enhanced Document Self-Awareness
```python
# Current response:
"I contain information about relativity in my physics section."

# GraphRAG-enhanced response:
"I explore relativity concepts throughout my structure - starting with basic 
principles in Chapter 2, connecting to mathematical foundations in Section 3.2, 
and culminating in practical applications in my final chapter. Let me trace 
this journey for you..."
```

### GraphRAG Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 2.1: Entity & Relationship Extraction
1. **Extract entities** from each chunk (people, concepts, dates, locations)
2. **Identify relationships** between entities within and across chunks
3. **Build document graph** with nodes (entities/concepts) and edges (relationships)

#### Phase 2.2: Graph-Enhanced Retrieval
1. **Hybrid search**: Combine vector similarity with graph traversal
2. **Path-based retrieval**: Find relevant information through concept paths
3. **Community detection**: Identify clusters of related concepts

#### Phase 2.3: Graph-Aware Generation
1. **Relationship-informed prompts**: Include relevant connections in context
2. **Structural awareness**: Reference document hierarchy in responses
3. **Cross-reference capabilities**: Link related concepts naturally

#### Technical Integration Points
```python
# Enhanced DocumentRAG class
class GraphEnhancedDocumentRAG(DocumentRAG):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        super().__init__(...)
        self.document_graph = self._build_document_graph()
        self.graph_retriever = GraphRetriever(self.document_graph)
    
    def _build_document_graph(self):
        # Extract entities and relationships from chunks
        # Build graph structure using NLP techniques
        pass
    
    def query_with_graph(self, question: str):
        # Combine vector search with graph traversal
        vector_results = self.retriever.get_relevant_documents(question)
        graph_results = self.graph_retriever.get_related_concepts(question)
        # Merge and rank results intelligently
        pass
```

## Phase 3: DoqToq Groups - Multi-Document Collaboration

### Revolutionary Vision

Transform DoqToq from a document conversation tool into a **multi-document knowledge synthesis platform** where documents become collaborative entities that can interact with users and each other.

### Core Concept: Documents as Collaborative Agents

#### Multi-Document Chat Orchestration
```
User: "What do you all think about climate change solutions?"

Research Paper: "From my scientific perspective, I present data showing 
renewable energy adoption rates..."

Policy Document: "I complement that with regulatory frameworks that could 
accelerate implementation..."

Technical Manual: "And I can detail the practical engineering challenges 
we'd need to overcome..."
```

#### Document-to-Document Interactions
```
Research Paper: "@Policy Document - Your regulatory timeline conflicts 
with my data on technology readiness"

Policy Document: "Interesting point, @Research Paper. Let me revise my 
assessment based on your findings..."

User: "Can you two find a middle ground?"
```

### DoqToq Groups Architecture

#### Multi-Agent RAG System
```python
class DoqToqGroup:
    def __init__(self, documents: List[str]):
        self.documents = [DocumentAgent(doc) for doc in documents]
        self.conversation_manager = ConversationOrchestrator()
        self.synthesis_engine = CrossDocumentSynthesizer()
        self.shared_knowledge_graph = SharedKnowledgeGraph()
    
    def group_chat(self, user_message: str):
        # Determine which documents should respond
        # Orchestrate multi-document conversation
        # Generate cross-document insights
        pass
```

#### Enhanced Document Agent
```python
class DocumentAgent(GraphEnhancedDocumentRAG):
    def __init__(self, file_path: str, personality_profile: str):
        super().__init__(file_path)
        self.personality = personality_profile
        self.peer_awareness = PeerDocumentManager()
        self.collaboration_history = CollaborationMemory()
    
    def respond_in_group(self, message: str, context: GroupContext):
        # Consider other documents' perspectives
        # Reference peer documents when relevant
        # Maintain individual personality while collaborating
        pass
```
